IOTA is a user-friendly front end for `dials.stills_process`, a serial
diffraction data processing program. IOTA is comprised of three main modules:

1.  Raw image import, pre-processing and triage
2.  Image indexing, lattice model refinement, and integration using
    `dials.stills_process`
3.  Analysis of the integrated dataset

IOTA can be run as a GUI or from the command-line; scripts can be used for
both, interchangeably. The GUI has the advantage of displaying useful
statistics; it can also be run in "monitor mode" during live data collection,
during which the program will wait for new images to be written into the
specified input folder. The command-line mode is useful if the program is run
remotely on servers that do not, for some reason, support graphics.

## Reference

Please note that IOTA is a front-end for other processing software. Therefore,
the preferred construction for citation should be something like "data were
processed with IOTA [1] using serial diffraction data reduction algorithms
implemented in DIALS [2, 3]".
